    <div id="FAQ">
        <p class="question">Q: "How do I join the team?"</p>
        <p class="answer">A: From the web control page, in the top left click
            “Change Identity”. From there, you can create a username, enter our
            team number (240440), and generate and enter a password for
            yourself!</p>
        <p class="question">Q: Why isn’t my computer working on WUs?</p>
        <p class="answer">A: Our best advice for people who are having trouble
            is in the desktop client, right-click any process that's been
            sitting at "Ready" for a while, pause it, wait 5 seconds, and then
            right-click and select "Fold". It'll bring the retry counter down
            from several minutes to about 30-60 seconds. Do this whenever the
            retry timer gets really high. Additionally, from the web client, you
            can click the "Stop folding" button, and click the "Stop folding"
            button in the next window (not the finish current WU option). Then,
            when the button turns green, click it to restart. This sometimes
            fixes stuck WU. The final thing that seems to help is, if both CPU
            and GPU are stuck at ready, go into your task manager, sort
            alphabetically, find the FAH32 process, and kill it. Then
            relaunch the desktop and web client simultaneously. None of these
            are guaranteed fixes, but they sometimes get the program to work
            again. Best to try one of these suggestions and then let it sit for
            about 5 mins, and if it still isn't working, try another suggestion.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Q: If I interrupt a WU partway through, do I lose
            progress?</p>
        <p class="answer">A: It depends. If you manually pause it, you shouldn't
            lose any progress. If your computer crashes or loses power, you
            might. For instances like this, FAH periodically automatically makes
            checkpoints, so if the program gets interrupted in this way, it’ll
            pick up from its last checkpoint the next time it is run. You can
            set your checkpoint interval in the desktop client.</p>
        <p class="question">Q: In general, how can I optimize my computer's
            performance?</p>
        <p class="answer">A: Generally speaking, a lower thermal environment
            leads to better automatic performance, i.e. the cooler you keep your
            computer, the farther your components should boost themselves! You
            can also often set manual fan curves for your case fans in your
            system's BIOS that are more aggressive than the default ones (note
            that depending on how aggressive, it could add extra wear to your
            cooling solution, but help the lifespan of the other components).
        </p>
        <p class="question">Q: More specifically, How can I optimize GPU
            performance?</p>
        <p class="answer">A: Look into the program "MSI Afterburner" if you
            don't already have it. It lets you fine-tune your graphics card's
            performance. Most of the time it's an overclocking tool, which is
            great if you're into that, but for the average user, we find that
            the simple fan control slider is a huge boon. For example, at default
            settings, Sam P.'s blower-style GPU would sit at ~80C. But after
            disabling the stock fan curve and moving the slider to be at 75%
            fan speed, not only did his temps get down to ~70C, but now his core
            clock is higher meaning he can finish a WU in a slightly shorter
            period of time. Bear in mind however, that the fan(s) on your GPU
            (if air cooled) is a point of failure, and running at 100% fan speed
            could affect its lifespan, hence why Sam is sticking to 75-80% max
            fan speed. Another option is to set a custom fan curve to
            dynamically adjust fan speed vs temperature, thereby allowing your
            fan to spin down when the GPU isn’t as hot (say in between WUs).
            Click the "gear" icon and navigate to the "Fan" tab (note that many
            laptops seem to not have this option). You can make all of your
            adjustments here. After making an adjustment, make sure to click
            "Apply", and then on the main monitoring screen, click the "check"
            box to apply your settings.</p>
        <p class="answer">TL;DR: using MSI afterburner to set your GPU fan speed
            to 75% decreases temps and ups performance.</p>
        <p class="question">Q: The webpage is constantly refreshing and I can’t
            see any stats. What should I do?</p>
        <p class="answer">A: This has to do with browser caching/cookies. You
            can manually clear the cache/cookies, but instead of clearing the
            cache/cookies every time, there are a couple of options. Going into
            the developer tools in your browser and disabling caching specifically
            for the webpage is one way. Just using another browser, for example,
            Microsoft Edge is another. Edge can be configured the to clear the
            cache, cookies and everything else everytime you close Edge. Just
            poke around in the settings!</p>
