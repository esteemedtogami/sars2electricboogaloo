            We're currently ranked 966 according to the Extreme Overclocking

            Ladies and gentlemen, folding at home has passed the exaflop
            barrier. We can now compute "more than 1,000,000,000,000,000,000
            operations per second, making us ~10x faster than the IBM Summit!"
            For those who are not familiar, IBM summit is the worlds fastest
            supercomputer. But thanks to people all over the world, we have
            shattered that. No wonder we are having issues with people getting
            work units. Its going to be so cool to see where we go from here.
            Let's keep folding! Thank you to Игорь Семкин for sharing the good
            news!!
        </p>
        <p class="Post">Edit: we have also exceeded 50,000,000 points, and are
            shooting up the rankings towards the top 1000 teams worldwide.
            Congrats!!
        </p>

        <p class="Post">*MAJOR UPDATE*</p>
        <p class="Post"> Hello everyone! The admins have elected to change our
            name to "Folding at Home Team 240440: Let's Help Stop COVID-19" to
            reflect the fact that we are not a group run by the official
            Folding at Home labs, and make our team number more accessible.
            Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns! I never
            expected this to blow up like it did, I thought it would just be a
            few friends and I, but here we are! And we are not alone.
            Before the coronavirus, about 30,000 people were working on F@H,
            but now we are at 400,000 people worldwide. According to Dr. Greg
            Bowman, the director of F@H, our total computing power now exceeds
            470 petaflops - 2x faster than the worlds fastest <a href="https://twitter.com/drGregBowman/status/1241037866215657472" target="_blank">supercomputer</a>.
            This is incredible! Summit has already <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/nordic-msp/ibm-supercomputer-summit-attacks-coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR2U7o8Xs_bGgsG9GQwWOOqjkzV_WF9qD10uSbam2msARzsuyjX2v9zFwTM" target="_blank">identified</a> 77 new compounds
            that may be viable as therapies for the coronavirus. We may be a bit
            behind on drug screening time-wise, but we have double the total
            computing power. Let's see what we can do! It looks like F@H is
            getting the attraction of the media. See more on that <a href="https://foldingathome.org/2020/03/18/news-articles-published-in-march/?fbclid=IwAR1TiZu7seBTpTRJ66B47gWHzWFng_ca8aNJAw9Iy8w0YWcXAuh6Xj9VzNY" target="_blank">here</a>.
            Also, the F@H has a goal of getting 1 million people folding! Let's
            try to spread the word on social media and by word of mouth. As a
            final (and highly important note) the spike protein and how it moves
            has been resolved, courtesy of us and everyone else all around the
            world! To my knowledge, an atom-by-atom simulation of this protein
            has never been done before. This protein is what the virus uses to
            get into your cells, and is currently the most attractive target for
            developing therapies. To watch it in motion, please check out Dr.
            Bowman's twitter post <a href="https://twitter.com/drGregBowman/status/1239629911310192640" target="_blank">here</a>.
            There is more to come! This is just the beginning. We are making
            tangible, critical progress. I believe the next step is to get a
            more detailed image of the viral spike protein, start to simulate
            other viral proteins, and screen drugs against the new protein
            models that we have come up with to see if they can inhibit them and
            possibly work as therapies down the line. More updates to come, but
            in the meantime, please share with friends! Thank you for all your
            time and effort that you are putting into this! It may just entail
            downloading a program and watching it run right now, but this has
            the potential to become something really important and meaningful
            for all of us. Let's keep folding!

        <p class="Post">We are now at almost 12,000,000 points! This is 6x what
            our initial goal for the week. Check out our stats <a href="https://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/team_summary.php?s&t=240440" target="_blank">here</a>.
            In other good news, we are now at 217 members, with people
            representing countries all over the world! The group grew so fast
            that there are too many new members for me to tag in this post.
            To all of you, welcome to our team! Our team number is 240440, and
            our team name SARS-CoV-2 Electric Boogaloo.

        <p class="Post">So our initial goal was to get 2,000,000 points by the
            end of the week... but today we passed 5,000,000! Congrats! I am
            currently working on making a google document to answer questions
            that people may have in my spare time. I will make it available for
            others to edit as well, with the hope that doing so will make it
            more comprehensive more quickly. For now, I have the posts with
            helpful info marked as "announcements" here at the top of the page.
            Also, here is our stats page on <a href="https://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/team_summary.php?s=&t=240440" target="_blank">folding.extremeoverclocking.com</a>.
            We are currently ranked 4,244, and have processed a total of 591
            WUs as of yesterday. Let's keep folding!

        <p class="Post">We have exceeded 1,000,000 points! Thank you everyone
            for taking the time to do this! It looks like they don't have enough
            work units to go around right now, and are prioritizing giving them
            to computers with heavy-hitting GPUs (correct me if I am wrong).
            Hopefully more are available soon! I was having an issue getting work
            units, but I ended all FAH processes via task manager and restarted
            FAH, which seemed to get it working again at least for now.</p>

        <p class="Post"> We have hit some more milestones! In less than 36 hours, we have:
        </p>
        <p class="Post"> 1) Grown to over 100 members from all over the world
        </p>
        <p class="Post"> 2) Gained 575,722 points!
        </p>
        <p class="Post"> This is despite many of us not getting projects
            assigned to work on due to the overhaul that F@H is likely doing
            right now. Congratulations!! Let's try to hit 2,000,000 by Saturday!
            While the official leaderboards are having some issues (they have
            other priorities right now), there appears to be a <a href="https://folding.extremeoverclocking.com/team_list.php?s=" target="_blank">third-party site</a>
            that is keeping track (updated 3/15/2020): We have a ways to go to
            get to the top 100, but if we have done this much in this little
            time, I have the utmost faith that we can get there. Keep on folding!

        <p class="Post"> Hello everyone! If your computer is currently not
            running any projects, to my knowledge it is likely because the
            people working on the software engineering and hardware side of this
            are working on "scaling up" the operation due to the massive influx
            of people joining. They will likely have more projects soon.
            If you have more detailed info, please feel free to comment and help
            clarify. To see what this project did to help fight the ebola virus,
            and get more updates on the current state of the coronavirus project,
